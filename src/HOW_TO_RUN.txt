This is a short excerpt from the readme detailing how to run the program.

Step 0: Go to the src directory:
```
cd src
```

Step 1: Compile the program:
```
make
```

Step 2: Run all successful test cases:
```
./test.sh
```

You should get an output like this:
```
Testing default1 ... OK
Testing default2 ... OK
Testing fibonacci ... OK
Testing many-func ... OK
Testing nest ... OK
Testing operator ... OK
Testing string-literal ... OK
Testing test-all-grammar ... OK
```

To run a single test (e.g. test/test-all-grammar.j):
```
./run.sh test-all-grammar
```

Parse error tests are in test/errors/ (e.g. test/errors/error-recover.j), and you have to run each one separately.  For example:
```
./run.sh errors/error-recover
```
