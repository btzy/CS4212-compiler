This is a short excerpt from the readme detailing how to run the program.

Step 0: Go to the src directory:
```
cd src
```

Step 1: Chmod the java archives for jflex and cup, and the scripts:
```
chmod u+x cup/*.jar
chmod u+x jflex/jflex-1.8.2/lib/*.jar
chmod u+x *.sh
```

Step 2: Compile the program:
```
make
```

Step 3: Run all successful test cases:
```
./test.sh
```

You should get an output like this:
```
Testing test/default ... OK
Testing test/expressions ... OK
Testing test/fast_exp ... OK
Testing test/loops ... OK
Testing test/multiclass ... OK
Testing test/overloading ... OK
Testing test/statements ... OK
```

To run a single test (e.g. test/fast_exp.j):
```
./run.sh fast_exp
```

Semantic error tests are in test/errors/ (e.g. test/errors/ambiguous_call.j), and you have to run each one separately.  For example (do each line separately!):
```
./run.sh errors/ambiguous_call
./run.sh errors/duplicate_class
./run.sh errors/duplicate_field
./run.sh errors/duplicate_method
./run.sh errors/if_condition
./run.sh errors/operator_plus
./run.sh errors/read_print
./run.sh errors/return_type
./run.sh errors/type_imbue
```

The expected output is also available in the `test/errors` directory.
